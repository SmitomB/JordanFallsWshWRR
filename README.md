The files here include data sets and codes for the following manuscript: Contrasting annual and summer phosphorus loading and retention rates using a hybrid Bayesian watershed model

There are two items in this repository:

RStaninputdata.rds- This is a R data file that includes all the input data sets. It needs to be imported into R with the appropriate command.

RStancode.R- RStan code needed to run the code. The "rstan" and "rstudioapi" packages need to be installed prior to running the model.
